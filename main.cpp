Project 3 - Part 1d / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
User-Defined Types

Continue your work on branch Part1

Purpose: The entire purpose of this 5-part project is to get you writing C++ code that compiles and to 
reinforce the syntax habits that C++ requires.  
What you create in this project will be used as the basis of Project 5 in the course.   

************************
Part1 purpose:  Learn to write UDTs

You are going to write 10 UDTs in project3.  
    Part 1a: you will learn to think about an object in terms of its sub-objects.
    Part 1b: you will write 4 un-related UDTs in plain english
    Part 1c: you will write 1 UDT in plain english that will be made of 5 related sub-objects
    Part 1d: you will write plain-english UDTs for the 5 sub-objects that form the UDT defined in Part 1c
    Part 1e: you will convert those 10 plain-english UDTs into code that runs.
************************

    The goal of this step is to get you to think about breaking down an object into smaller and smaller objects, 
    until the smallest object is made of up only C++ primitives. 

    Continuing the previous example:  Cell Phone

    A Cell Phone is made up of the following 5 properties/sub-objects and 3 actions:
        Display
        Memory
        CPU
        Radio
        Applications
    3 actions:
        make a call
        send a text
        run an application.

    These 5 properties can be broken down into their own sub-objects and properties. 

    If we break down the first property 'Display' into its 5 properties we get:
        brightness
        amount of power consumed.
        pixels
        width in cm
        height in cm

    the Display's brightness can be represented with a Primitive, such as a double. 

    The amount of power consumed can also be represented with a Primitive, such as a float or integer (i.e. 250mWa)
    
    The 'pixels' property must be represented with an array of Pixel instances, as the screen has more than 1 row of pixels.
        Arrays have not been discussed and can't be used in this project.
        Instead, we can use an Integer primitive to store the Number of Pixels:

    Display:
        Number of Pixels
        Amount of Power consumed (milliwatt-hours)
        Brightness
        width in cm
        height in cm
************************

1) Fill in #5 - #9 with plain-english UDTs for the 5 properties you created for UDT #10
    example: 
        If #10's first property was 'Engine', then your `Thing 5)` will be `Engine` and 
        you will need to provide 5 properties and 3 member functions of that Engine object in plain English
